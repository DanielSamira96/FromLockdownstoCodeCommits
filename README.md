# From Lockdowns to Code Commits: COVID-19â€™s Footprint on GitHub
This repository contains the code and analyses for my academic project, **"From Lockdowns to Code Commits: COVID-19's Footprint on GitHub"**. The project examines how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted GitHub activities, focusing on changes in event trends and developer behavior from 2017 to 2022. 

Key analyses include:
1. **Event Volume Trends**: Identifying changes in GitHub event volumes using statistical and time-series methods.
2. **Day-Specific Trends**: Exploring shifts in activity patterns, such as increased weekend contributions during remote work.
